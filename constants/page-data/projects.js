          While developing my portfolio and documenting my work history, I initially faced challenges due to my limited design background.
          To tackle this, I drew inspiration from various sources and eventually built the site using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, React, and MongoDB.
          I took a hands-on approach, creating nearly everything from scratch‚Äîincluding the layout, content, visuals, and more.
          
          This experience deepened my appreciation for persistence and adaptability, reflecting my commitment to continuously improving in both software engineering and design.
          I'm proud of the result and plan to keep refining and enhancing it over time.
