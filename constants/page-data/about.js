  about: `
    a software engineer driven by a passion for creating seamless, high-performing front-end experiences. I've had the opportunity to work with diverse technologies and in various environments.
    Although front-end development is my main area of expertise, I excel as a generalist—bringing together full-stack skills to tackle complex problems.
    My experience in developer tooling has deepened my interest in building solutions that help fellow developers boost their efficiency and productivity.
    
    <br/><br/>
    I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Information Systems major) from Universitas Indonesia and plan to pursue a Master’s Degree to strengthen my technical and critical thinking skills.
    During my undergraduate years, I served as a Teaching Assistant (TA) in 10+ courses, fueling my passion for mentorship and collaborative learning, and 
    I was actively competed in diverse tech competitions across software development, game design, data science, and cybersecurity. 
    
    <br/><br/>
    I’m always excited about meaningful collaborations, new challenges, and a good tech chat. Feel free to connect!

  my_journey: `
    Fueled by a passion for technology, I began my journey by exploring the basics — computer I/O concepts, hardware, and software. 
    This curiosity led me to pursue a degree in Information Technology, where I ventured into diverse fields such as software engineering, UI/UX design, data science, AI development, game development, and IT-business case studies.

    Over time, I discovered that my true interests lie in Software Engineering, UI Design, Ubiquitous Computing, and Writing. 
    Supported by inspiring mentors, university courses, and countless self-taught lessons, I committed myself to this exciting path. 
    My growth has been shaped by hands-on experience, insightful tutorials on YouTube, and a wide range of enriching resources that continue to fuel my passion for building, designing, and sharing ideas through technology.
