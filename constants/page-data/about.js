  about: `
    a software engineer driven by a passion for creating seamless, high-performing front-end experiences. I've had the opportunity to work with diverse technologies and in various environments.
    Although front-end development is my main area of expertise, I excel as a generalist‚Äîbringing together full-stack skills to tackle complex problems.
    My experience in developer tooling has deepened my interest in building solutions that help fellow developers boost their efficiency and productivity.
    
    <br/><br/>
    I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (Information Systems major) from Universitas Indonesia and plan to pursue a Master‚Äôs Degree to strengthen my technical and critical thinking skills.
    During my undergraduate years, I served as a Teaching Assistant (TA) in 10+ courses, fueling my passion for mentorship and collaborative learning, and 
    I was actively competed in diverse tech competitions across software development, game design, data science, and cybersecurity. 
    
    <br/><br/>
    I‚Äôm always excited about meaningful collaborations, new challenges, and a good tech chat. Feel free to connect!

  my_journey: `
    I come from a small village in Bogor, Indonesia, and I feel truly grateful for the journey that led me into software engineering, filled with both challenges and personal growth.
    I was not always the top student, but during high school, I developed a genuine interest in math, physics, and programming. Even though I had limited support at the time, that passion became the foundation for my understanding of computer science.
    
    <br/><br/>
    I later earned a place at the University of Indonesia to study Information Systems despite coming from unpopular high school, where I explored both technical subjects in computer science and concepts in business.
    During my time there, I joined various IT-related competitions, volunteer activities, and student initiatives. My goal was not to be the best, but to keep improving and expanding my knowledge and skills.
    These efforts also led me to internships at respected companies such as Ninja Van, Accenture, Mandiri, and GudangAda. Each opportunity contributed meaningfully to my professional development.
    
    <br/><br/>
    Through this journey, I have come to understand that what matters most is not where you begin, but how persistent, curious, and open you are to every opportunity that comes your way. 
    My growth has been shaped by hands-on experience, insightful tutorials on YouTube, and a wide range of enriching resources that continue to fuel my passion for building, designing, and sharing ideas through technology.
